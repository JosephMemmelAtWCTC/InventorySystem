(For Submission)

Improvements made:
- Switched over to models for the primary data types (filters/settings not yet moved)
- Implemented collections for storing the models & interacting with them, add, move, etc.
- Created components in order to further usage of SRP - removed :categoriesList/:itemsList and put them in as a single passable-in list.

Changes made:
- Lots of old functionality I have not been able to make work again
- Cleared out old defunct code and moved over index2.html & app2.js to b index.html & app.js again, removed some no longer needed commented out code
