From the feedback given in class (and your own ideas), identify 3-5 things to improve on. These could be:

    Squashing bugs. (This is one thing. 3 bugs = 1 thing to improve)
    Making components more reusable (i.e. Give your modal component more props or slots to make it multi-purpose).
    Improving the UI/UX. Use the Mental Notes 

    Links to an external site. app to brainstorm some ideas.
    Clean up the design. Work on learning the utility classes or components of the UI framework to improve the look and feel.
    Add features (e.g. edit, search, sort, magnet wobble, etc).
    Utilize a new UI framework. Tired of Bootstrap? Try Vuetify, Quasar, Element Plus, Vuestic, or something else.

Take an honest assessment of your skills and what you could improve on. In addition to the application, please turn in a list of improvements that you made.
